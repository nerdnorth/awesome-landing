    <h1 align="center">Maker Mob</h1>
    <p>Every day I get emails from makers who have just created their first &quot;thing.&quot;</p>
    <p>A few of these are <strong>exceptional</strong>. The maker has clearly put in a ton of time and effort into creating a <strong>high quality </strong>project. Often, these are <em>tiny products</em>. They started small, shipped it, and are looking for their first customers.</p>
    <p><strong>The hard part is trust</strong>. People don't know them yet, so they don't trust them. To get traction, you need people to buy your thing, use it, and tell others about it (this is what builds trust). But if people don't know who you are, they're not willing to take that initial plunge.</p>
    <h2 align="center">Here's an idea</h2>
    <p>Have you heard of a <strong>flash mob</strong>? It's when a large group of people  suddenly show up at the same place, at the same time to perform a specific action.</p>
    <p><strong>What if we did that, but for new makers?</strong> A bunch of us agree to show up, and help a maker with their launch.</p>
    <p>Practically, this looks like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>buying their small product</li>
      <li>trying it out</li>
      <li>telling people about it</li>
      <li>provide constructive feedback</li>
    </ul>
<p>For most of us, spending $10 isn't a big deal. But for the <strong>maker</strong> it's a <strong>huge deal</strong>. Someone on the internet just gave them money! It gives them the confidence to keep going; it alleviates their anxiety. Plus: they get that initial traction they need.</p>
<p>Let's do this! (<a href="smsfeedback.html">Here's what other people thought of the idea</a>)</p>
    <div class="mob">

    <h2>Currently we're mobbing:</h2>
    <p><strong>Name: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ichris">Chris Enns</a></p>
    <p><strong>Bio: </strong>Chris helped create a small (and beloved) podcast network called Goodstuff.fm. He's been thinking about making a small product for years, and finally pushed himself to make a video course.</p>
    <p><strong>Product:</strong> <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/123483251">Snapchat 101</a> - $7</p>
    <p><strong>Why: </strong>Chris' little Snapchat course is the <strong>perfect </strong>example of starting small. He saw a need (old people like me are confused by Snapchat) and created a series of video tutorials that solve that pain. And he overdelivered! He created 10 videos, and 2 PDFs. Everything looks (and sounds) professional.</p>

    <p>How do you submit a product for consideration? Right now we don't have a process for that. I'm thinking we'll eventually use something like <a href="http://sponsor.megamaker.co/projects/upstarter/">Upstarter</a>.</p>
