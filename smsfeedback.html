    <h1 align="center">Maker Mob feedback</h1>
    <p>On April 15th, I texted the <a href="sms:+14242475762">MegaMaker SMS</a> list and asked them about the <a href="index.html">Maker Mob</a> idea. Here's what they said:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Good idea!
        </li>
      <li>Love it. Is there anything I can do to help?
        </li>
      <li>This is brilliant!
        </li>
      <li>Hi Justin! I love the idea. I'll buy tonight!
        </li>
      <li>Amazing! Way to use your powers for good
        </li>
      <li>Awesome. Reminds me of what Gumroad has going a while back w the &quot;small product lab&quot;. </li>
      <li>Holy shit. This is something I was thinking about! So happy to see this.
        </li>
      <li>Very cool idea
        </li>
      <li>Jesse Tevelow is starting http://mylaunchteam.com - very similar idea. So, it probably has legs. Organizing a team of people to (help launch) is also interesting.
        </li>
      <li>Great idea! üòÑüëç Would help a lot of makers like myself that aren't world-famous yet üòâ
        </li>
      <li>Pretty awesome product. Super impressed!!
        </li>
      <li>It's totally awesome. I'm working on an ADHD Productivity project. I'll keep you posted.
        </li>
      <li>Yes, I have a related project in pondering uxsnapcast.com
        </li>
      <li>INCREDIBLE IDEA
        </li>
      <li>Love it! Great idea.
        </li>
      <li>Would be great if you created a calendar and people signed up for days
        I think it's great.¬†¬†Launching something soon and would love this type of feedback
        </li>
      <li>Yes definitely!
        </li>
      <li>Yea man m, already bought his snapchat course tho :)
        </li>
      <li>This is cool that you reply to SMS. Do you read all the emails, too? I've been holding to the last email while i figure out how to answer.
        </li>
      <li>Interesting
        </li>
      <li>I like the idea of supporting makers, I'm hesitant about dropping the $. But given its a promising project that will make a difference I can get on board.
        </li>
      <li>Oh yeah
        </li>
      <li>Brilliant!
        </li>
      <li>Love it. Ordered and interested to see where this goes as a community effort!
        </li>
      <li>Maybe so. Or maybe these are separate ideas. Really like the idea of makers having access to the mob to get initial feedback. Seems like that should be available to many with the fee and perhaps you vetting out any junk products. (Keep in mind I am two minutes into this whole idea. I could be way off the mark)</li>
      <li>Loving this whole text message thing. It gives me that whole, &quot;I can just text Justin&quot; feeling. :)
        </li>
      <li>Love the idea! I am going to support these guys!
        How about the makers pay a fee to get access to the mob. Then the mob could rate the products after.
        </li>
      <li>Some mob members may have decent sized audiences. If I genuinely liked something, I could put it in my newsletter to 1450 people. I would love to be a mob focus with userinput.io next month. &quot;Share alliances&quot; can be great.
        </li>
      <li>This is awesome
        </li>
      <li>Yes definitely (supporting other people is one of my favorite things to do), </li>
      <li>I'm really feeling the upstarter idea as well. I think having a share option for people that can't afford paying might be interesting as well. It won't affect the up vote but the indication that people are sharing is there.
        </li>
      <li>Love it! Reminds me of my work with the Awesome Foundation where great things come from small projects
        </li>
      <li>If something like this happens in my area (Toronto) I would definitely jump in to help another maker. Cool Justin
        </li>
      <li>Yeah! This is a cool idea, it will definitely help some of those great projects which need help gaining visibility in places like product hunt. Do we collectively decide on who should be mobbed? How does selection work?
        </li>
      <li>Makers are smart, they probably see if the product sticks or not. Keep me posted on this one. And thanks for the human reply. :)
        </li>
      <li>Yeah definitely. At the very least it's giving the maker and their product a little publicity
        </li>
      <li>That's a very cool idea!!
        </li>
      <li>For sure! This hits a bad pain point with me wanting to launch stuff.
        </li>
      <li>Stellar idea! I love the idea, but would be resistant to buying several 10$ purchases in a row would inflict some burn out.
        </li>
      <li>Great idea. That would be fun p
        </li>
      <li>I am think so. Checking out the Snapchat course now.
        </li>
      <li>I like it! But actually the idea of setting up something where makers go to mob it with other maker, that would be amazing!
        </li>
      <li>That's a pretty cool idea. üòÅ
        </li>
      <li>Yes. Excellent idea.
        </li>
      <li>Might actually work, but could give a false sense of validation.
        </li>
      <li>Awesome idea!
        </li>
      <li>I love this idea! (And I bought the snapchat course!)
        </li>
      <li>Ooh! I like it
        </li>
      <li>Haha
        </li>
      <li>I just checked it out. I think you're creative energy rocks. I'll mob - hell yeah.
        </li>
      <li>I like this idea for promotion the mob member's projects, but am concerned about encouraging people to just buy them because it could create false positives.
        </li>
      <li>This is a great idea, Love it!!!
        </li>
      <li>Genius. Reminds me of Lowercase Alpha
        </li>
      <li>I'll do anything you say! Laugh out loud.
        </li>
      <li>Very cool
        </li>
      <li>I would love to be part of the mob and check out cool projects :)
        </li>
      <li>Oh yeah
        </li>
      <li>good idea
        </li>
      <li>I love this idea so much
        </li>
      <li>I think it's cool but I wouldn't use that guide because I use snapchat already
        </li>
      <li>Love the idea!
        </li>
      <li>That's awesome
        </li>
      <li>Super cute! I love it.
        </li>
      <li>This is rad</li>
